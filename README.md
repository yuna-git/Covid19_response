# Covid19_response
Since early April, Imperial College London and YouGov have been surveying people in 29 countries about their coronavirus-related behaviors and opinions. Topics include 
mask usage, self-isolation, working from home, vaccinations, and economic activity. The purpose of this project is to investigate whether/which kind of people's behavior
would affect the spreading of COVID-19, and how people can better protect themselves and families
